This project involves analyzing survey data on Organizational Behaviour, focusing on the relationships between Emotional Intelligence (EI), Self-Efficacy (SE), Work Engagement (WE), and Job Autonomy. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, and hypothesis testing, such as evaluating the correlation between EI and WE, SE and WE, and conducting mediation and moderation analyses to understand how SE and Job Autonomy influence these relationships. The findings provide insights into the role of emotional and job-related factors in enhancing work engagement within organizations.
